################## INSTALLATION
Find your victoria 2 installation and put this folder (MishMashMapMod) and the .mod file in the mod folder,
then select /Mish Mash Map Mod/ (slashes so it comes before all other mods) from the launcher on game start. 

May be overriden by other mods that provide their own new version of these assets, so if you want to make sure 
MMMM works as expected, you may need to navigate to the relevent files in other mods which employ them and either 
delete them (keep a backup) or rename them (append .old or something). Most issues should be circumvented by the
prefixed slash on the mod name, since Victoria 2 prioritizes mod assets by which one comes first alphabetically.
Non-conflicting files won't break the mod of course, but if they clash stylistically then you may want to handle
those as well.

Mixing mods with overlapping assets has broken saves on one occasion in my experience, so beware. Probably not a
problem - probably.

################## CONTENTS
Contains a new water map, political map, overlay tiling, borders and font. 

Includes assets from the CountryColors mod and CoolMapMod (Overlay, Political map, Water map), tweaked
by me.

Includes CaptRobau's font mod for solid country names, readme for
that is also available.

################## SHADERS
The shaders for high quality terrain on the political map are not included in MMMM itself - they come in the TerrainShader mod,
which must be installed and acivated in the same manner as this if you want that feature. I split them up so you can easily use
the terrain shaders separately for your own projects.
